Look into the distance for 20 seconds at something 20 yards away (~18 meters) every 20 minutes.\n\n    Eat healthily! A balanced diet is good for eye health as it is for general health! Fruit, vegetables and oily fish are a great start.\n\n    Shield your eyes from excessively strong sun – a source of UVA and UVB radiation – with sunglasses.

  "about_myopiai_1": "MyopiAI is a smartphone application conceived and built to be part of a solution to the complex problem that is the myopia pandemic. By 2050, 5 billion people, that is half of the world’s population, will be myopic or ‘short-sighted’ and 1 billion of those people will suffer from high myopia which is a significant risk factor for potentially sight-threatening diseases such as glaucoma, retinal detachment and myopic macular degeneration.(1)\n",
  "about_myopiai_2": "This smartphone app attempts to educate users about their own eye health through analysing their spectacles (glasses) or contact lens prescription. It also aims to tackle risk factors for myopia progression. Namely, behavioural risk factors, such as spending excessive time indoors, and not enough time outdoors in natural light. Through time tracking, users will be able to understand how much time they spend indoors and outdoors, increasing their time outdoors through gamification which current best evidence suggests could be helpful in slowing myopia progression.(2) The also encourages good near work habits, such as taking breaks and working in adequate lighting conditions. Important for both eye health and productivity.\n",
  "about_myopiai_3": "This app also hopes to promote positive general health habits, such as spending more time doing outdoors doing physical activity/exercise, through its feature set. It is hoped that through continuous iteration and expansion of the feature set, this app will make a real impact and contribution to the overall wellbeing of smartphone users.(3)\n",
  "about_myopiai_4": "Thoughtfully, crafted by clinicians, graphic artists, user-interface designers and full-stack app developers passionate about digital health, MyopiAI is the first app of MyopiAI Ltd. \n",
